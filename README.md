## Pros of TDD

- help with developer think of all possible branches when writing tests
- automate function checking
- help with debugging
- lead to more modular structure
- decoupled functions leading to less maintain difficulties
- the tests suggests the usage of the functions (work as sort of documentation)


## Cons of TDD

- extra time spend on writing tests before implementing
- bad tests may make debugging harder
- may only write code for tests(corner case not implemented/only corner case implemented)
- need to be changed when new requirement comes or changes
